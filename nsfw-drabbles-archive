This is a thread for anyone who wants to write a longform fanfic in the Discord chat!

Due to wanting to keep long-form spoiler box spam out of the main nsfw-tarot channel, we implore you to use this thread to write drabbles, co-operative writing, or "fanfic popcorning" in this thread.

Rules:

1.) Only ping the listed moderators in this thread.
Not all of our moderators are comfortable monitoring NSFW/Sexual content. Please avoid pinging all Major Arcana or Minor Arcana here!

List of  current active mods here:
Percy
Kritta
Steph
Sarah
Moon

2.) Use spoiler boxes as much as possible.
 - Though it seems counter-intuitive to require spoiler boxes in a NSFW thread, we highly urge their use here as many people check this thread at work or have computers/phones accessible to family.

3.) Content warn/trigger warn as necessary.
 - E.g.: Gore, violence, nicotine, alcohol, trauma responses.

4.) Sexual content with ANY of the minor characters of TTS is NOT permitted.
 -  Headcanoning minor characters as "older" as a caveat of your fanfic is fine.
 - Discord TOS does not allow depictions of minors in sexual acts or scenarios. Even if you are someone that explores this kind of fic on your own time, someone who isn't fond of it has the ability to report your account to Discord for breaking TOS boundaries.

Reminders:

1.) Unwarranted criticism of a fanfic may be removed at any time. People providing you with free content are not subject to explain their skill level, ship, or morals to you.

2.) Fanfic that causes discomfort among a majority of users will be removed completely. This boundary is broad, and will be played by ear of what the fic entails if we get receive complaints.

3.) Liveblogging fanfiction is fine!

"Don't look now - Station 33 sent another one over." Rune says hanging up the delicate suncatcher by the studio door so it would throw dappled colors all around. 

"Fucking have it out for us is what this is." Brand grumbled from the back where he was organizing his tools. "Alright lets see how long this one las-

"Oh you're in such trouble." Rune laughs as Brand catches sight of Tall, Blonde and Fucking Gorgeous. He's dressed fully but in just the right way to suggest that if you peel all that off? You're in for a real good time. 

"Fuck you." Brand humms walking up to him just as Gorgeous smiles and walks up to the open studio doors..

Poor grumpy Brand thought a lighthouse was a loner's dream come true. LMAO he thought

ok - following Merfolk Atlantean idea from main chat - 

Brand's always loved the ocean, something pulled him to it all his life, ever since a trip to visit an aunt who lived there. He had been barely 5 at the time but he made a friend there - a little boy with ocean blue-gray eyes and a voice like summer wind. They had played together and the boy had given him a piece of sea glass - one Brand still wore on a leather cord around his neck. When he had tried to find the boy the next day however, no one seemed to know about him,  told him his imaginary friend must have been a mermaid. Only his aunt had taken him seriously - told him of legends of a sunken city under the waves, lost to history. 

He had been fond of them then, and now when they were the only memories he had of his favorite aunt.

I had Thirst about firefighters, headcanoned a naughty thing, it became blacksmith!Brand and went from there
✒ faberge egglorru 🖤💀💜 — 05/30/2022 5:51 PM
awwww Brand with his pretty blue gray pebble but now it's sea glass 🥺
strumi
strumi tell me there's some ~intricate ritual~ that makes the sea glass a proposal
they got baby engaged at age five and yes it could be set aside as just silly children doing an adult tradition but they could hold to it...if they both wanted...but haha the other one wouldn't want that right? ...right?
pining

😉  we'll see
birb birjrbrbb — 05/30/2022 5:58 PM
Is this a "everyone quits bc they can't handle working with Brands....brandness, and lowkey he doesn't want help Rune just keeps saying he needs help so he enjoys scaring  new ones away but this one won't leave and is hot " situation 
Astrumiel🌙 of the Nightglade ☥ — 05/30/2022 6:00 PM
yesssss 
and maybe a certain firefighter will help Brand not only realize it but open himself up to taking a few chances
Casey the Hyped-Up Brand — 05/30/2022 6:01 PM
Rune suggests Addam brings a firehouse at some point because Brand’s very thirsty
Addam hoses them both
🔥Kade🔥 — 05/30/2022 6:05 PM
Omg imagine there’s a terrible storm, and brand spends the night staring out into the rain and lighting worrying about his friend, and in the morning he walks out onto the beach and sees the flash of scales, and the shape of a merman washed up onto the sand, not moving
Casey the Hyped-Up Brand — 05/30/2022 6:06 PM
…..
I TYPOED AND JUST REALIZED IT
FireHOSE
not a whole ass firehouse
Astrumiel🌙 of the Nightglade ☥ — 05/30/2022 6:18 PM
Maybe thirty years later Brand stands alone , feet barely touching the ocean as the waves roll in - its quiet, no tourists here today. In the distance he can see what might be dolphins playing . . . and for a split second like a pair of eyes watching him. Gone before he turns his head but he's so sure he felt it. 

The next morning its the same when he goes out on his run, tempted to take a swim after because the water calls him so. 

Maybe he runs into a gorgeous man who's running on the beach too - all blonde hair, freckles and eyes so warm brown they almost look red in the right light . . .
KADE YES
Ohhh so many freaking brilliant ideas - Royalty Rune with his betrothed Addam, finding the human Rune proposed to years ago? Scoping him out together. 
Brand finding one of them injured after a storm? Nursing him back to health (do they speak the same language? speak at all?) Does the other come looking for their mate and think Brand kidnapped him? 
Does Brand almost drown in a storm and wake up to the glimpse of a tail returning to the sea - which leads him to dive into his aunts book of legends and leave an offering at the shore? 

SO. MANY.GOOD.IDEAS
🔥Kade🔥 — 05/30/2022 6:25 PM
Brand finds his friend on the shore, not moving, and he’s not going to LEAVE him, so he scoops the merman up on his shoulder in a fireman’s carry, and hauls him back to the fire house. Brand plops him into the empty bathtub and then shit, he needs SALT WATER and schlepps up and down the beach with a pair of buckets until he’s got the bath tub filled and his friend is safe

:blurry_eyes~1: oh hello mixing ideas here

Just thinking about Addam and Rune, happily together and sharing stories one night, when Rune sheepishly admits to, when he was a child, having given sea glass to a human boy who he had almost kissed but backed out of and proposed to instead, Addam laughing and teasing Rune, telling him "Well, we ought to find your other husband someday as well then, I wouldn't want him to be too left out..."
Astrumiel🌙 of the Nightglade ☥ — 05/30/2022 6:27 PM
y'allll are making me insane YESSSSSSSS :thurston:
✒ faberge egglorru 🖤💀💜 — 05/30/2022 6:47 PM
bb Rune being utterly hypnotized and flustered because bb Brand's eyes were prettier than the entire ocean, and when they meet again they're just as beautiful, they haven't changed at all in all this time
🔥Kade🔥 — 05/30/2022 6:52 PM
Meanwhile, Rune wouldn’t have even BEEN there if he wasn’t is  a big ol dummy trying to save Brand. The deep ocean is pretty much unaffected by storms on the surface, but rune saw the hurricane rolling in and was terrified that his friend, who lived in a tiny spiral of a thing right on the oceans edge, would be swept out to sea by the wind and waves. Addam begged him to stay home, it’s too dangerous to go to the surface in weather like this, but Rune was adamant. 

And now Addam is frantically searching for Rune, who he thinks is washed up somewhere and left to dry out to death on the sands, or battered to death by flotsam and jetsam, not knowing that rune is perfectly safe in Brand’s bathtub
